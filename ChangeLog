    during compilation as an error.

- 7/16/2006, Channel Bridges
  For MOSREF, we need the ability to multiplex multiple channels across a single
  channel.  The bridge module provides the necessary capabilities.

  * Added the lib/bridge module
  * Added (make-bridge xmit recv) -> bridge to lib/bridge
  * Added (make-lane xmit recv) -> lane to lib/bridge
  * Added (bridge-lanes bridge) -> channel of lane to lib/bridge
  * Added (lane-recv bridge) -> channel of string to lib/bridge
  * Added (lane-xmit bridge) -> channel of string to lib/bridge

- 7/14/2006, Formal Filters
  With the introduction of channels, a number of similar operations have been
  cluttering up the Mosquito Library.  The new lib/filter module provides a
  unified way to describe and arrange these filter operations.

  * Added the (define-filter formals stmt ...) macro to lib/filter
  * Added the (input-chain channel filter ...) function to lib/filter
  * Added the (output-chain channel filter ...) function to lib/filter
  * Added the (error-on-fail message_ function to lib/filter
  * Modified s-filter from lib/filter to use the new define-filter form.
  * Modified line-filter from lib/filter to use the new define-filter form.
  * Modified repl from lib/repl to use input-chain to arrange s-filter and
    line-filter to parse input.
  * Added (crc32 string), which calculates the CRC32 of a given string.
  * Added lib/checksum-filter, which prepends a checksum to each string, and
    checks the checksum.
  * Added quad->string, word->string, byte->string prims.
  * Revised MOSREF's affiliation and transport protocols to use the new 
    filters and CRC32.
  * Added test/filter to test the functions listed above.
  * Updated 

- 6/03/2006, Broken lib/lib
  * Broke lib/lib into smaller components and integrated them with lib/compile,
    lib/assemble, lib/optimize and lib/freeze to fix the make-procedure
    reliance on lib/eval.
  * Fixed test-compile

- 5/27/2006, Buffer Merged With String
  * Modified string to be internally identical to the buffer type.
  * Removed the buffer type, and altered all functions matching *buffer* to 
    *string*; note that write-buffer and read-buffer are now string-write and
    string-read, respectively.
  * Added string-alter!, string-prepend!, string-append!, string-erase!,
    string-insert!
  * Replaced all uses of buffer-empty? to empty-string?
  * Added copy-string
  * Removed lib/scan, since strings with prepend can do the same, faster.
  * Modified lib/xml to pass a single buffer around, instead of copying
    and making buffers repeatedly.

- 5/15/2006, Accelerated XML Parsing
  * All XML parser rules now use string-begins-with? to shortcut the regular
    expression parsing step.  This greatly accelerates XML parsing by reducing
    use of match-regex.
  * Added an ellision operation to lib/trace's traceback that makes tracebacks
    involving extremely large strings manageable.
  * Added the lib/scan module, which wraps the buffer type to permit "peeking"
    one byte at a time into the buffer.  This is a frequent use by string
    parsers.
  * Added (buffer-skip-space buffer) to core primitives; will skip all
    whitespace leading the buffer.
  * Parsing XML attributes now uses the new scan module and logic implemented
    in Mosquito Lisp to compensate for the incredible time penalties inflicted
    by the regex "greedy match" algorithms.

- 5/14/2006, Bugfix for Tc-Splice!
  * tc-splice will no longer cannibalize the supplied list's structure.
  * Added (get-sxml-tag sxml) to lib/xml
  * Added (has-sxml-tag? sxml tag) to lib/xml
  * Added (has-sxml-attr? sxml key value) to lib/xml
  * Added (sxml-drill sxml test ...) to lib/sxml; example: 
    >> (define xml '(html (body (p "alpha" (a (@ (href . "a")) "aleph")) (p "beta"))))
    >> (sxml-drill xml is-body? is-p? is-a?)
    :: (a (@ (href . "a")) "aleph")
  * lib/xml's parser now handles sequential comments more reliably.
  * Added (strip string) to core primitives; strip removes leading and trailing
    whitespace from the string.
  * Added (strip-head string) to core primitives.
  * Added (strip-tail string) to core primitives.
  * make-sxml is now more intelligent about character data blocks, concatenating contiguous blocks together
    into a single sxml node.
  * string-head and string-tail no longer complain when given a length that
    exceeds the string length -- the length is adjusted quietly to the string's
    length.

- 4/18/2006, XML Parser
  * Added lib/mailto-url.ms, support for mailto URLs that was written in 
    response to documentation's request for a simpler usage of 
    register-url-parser.
  * Fixed module header in lib/http-url.ms
  * Added file-len, file-pos, file-seek and file-skip methods for file ports
    to lib/file-port
  * Added bin/incr-repl.ms, a REPL that logs each instruction to a file to
    simplify the incremental creation of MOSVM applications and test suites.
  * Added assoc prim to core.
  * Modified open-input-file to correctly return *eof* when read-descr yields
    #f to indicate end of the file.
  * Modified read <port> to correctly use the close method to close the port
    instead of just marking it out of service.
  * Added -g flag to the MOSVM stub; invoking the stub with -g will cause a 
    list of global variables to be displayed prior to exit.
  * Added lib/xml.ms, a library that parses XML strings and files into S-XML
    data structures. 

- 4/14/2006, Miscellaneous Bug Fixes
  * Added test directory to package target.
  * Overhauled lib/build to rely on core/module and lib/module.
  * Fixed build-exe when used to compile a module to a binary.
  * Added (read-platform-stub platform)
  * Added stub path configuration to bin/situation.sh
  * Restored queue class definition to lib/queue.
  * Extended read-descr-line to support file descriptors.
  * Altered lib/crypto-port to only operate on 64k messages at a time to
    avoid the possibility of a garbled message header causing an absurdly
    large buffer to be constructed.
  * Fixed cyclic dependency of lib/lib on lib/eval by deferment
  * Added import of lib/string-port to lib/format
  * Restored ignore-method to core/macro
  * Added import of lib/eval to lib/mosc.
  * Fixed bug when compiling under mosvm
  * Added export of read-line from lib/string-port

    and exports.
  * Modified the Makefile to make package work.

- 4/3/2006, HTTP Server Module

    to the console descriptor.
  * Added the *console-input-port* global, which is an input-port that reads 
    from the console descriptor.
  * Added the current-input-port procedure to lib/core, which returns the

    based on treaps.
  * Fixed a bug involving errors in mqo_compare due to implicit sign conversion
    issues when subtracting pointers.

  * Tagged all source files with BSD/NA license.

- 1/2/2006, Refit of Primitive Argument Macros to use Error System.
  * Primitive argument macros now signal errors using mqo_errf instead of
    dumping core with an assertion.
  * Primitive option macros now indicate absence using has_##nm; e.g. has_arg1

- 1/1/2006, Introduction of Call Value Tracebacks
  * Calls now push the number of arguments passed on the return stack.
  * Returns now clear the number of arguments passed from the return stack.
  * Closures now have a name field; when the closure is created, this field
    is #f.

    name field is updated to the global name. 
  * The internal traceback function can now display arguments to closures in
    the return stack, and their names if they are available.

- 12/30/2005, Introduction of the PROGRAM and INSTRUCTION object types
  * Added the Instruction object type which encodes a single MOSVM instruction
    as a record of fixed length.
  * Added the Procedure object type which encodes a sequence of MOSVM
    Instruction records.
  * Replaced mqo_op_names and mqo_op_prims with mqo_op_table, which also
    specifies what operands a given instruction operator employs.
  * Added instruction to show for use by il-traceback.
  * Added program to show for use by main.
  * Added the fakevm.scm file; a library of functions that can simulate mosvm
    features sufficiently to bootstrap the compilation of a mosvm compiler.
  * Rewrote assemble.scm to use the new program and instruction types. 
  * Modified bin/run-mzscheme.scm to load fakevm.scm
  * Modified bin/run-guile.scm to load fakevm.scm
  * Revised mosvm/memory.h macros to auto generate fv / vf / is inlines.
  * Replaced MQO_IX with MQO_IP, a reference to the current instruction.
  * Altered exec.c to use the new instruction and program types.
  * Altered main.c to use the new program type.
  * Modified primitives in prim/vm.c to use the new mqo_instruction type for
    their inline arguments.
  * Modified thaw.c to decode the program type.
  * Modified freeze.scm to encode the program type.
  * Added mqo_errf, a printf-like error facility for primitives and functions.
  * Expanded il_traceback to give a stack dump and a rudimentary call trace.

- 12/27/2005, Introduction of VMSTATE and IL-Traceback
  * Added the new vmstate object type to encapsulate vm information contained
    by continuations and errors.
  * Added the il-traceback primitive for displaying a low level dump of the
    virtual machine state.
  * Added a test for compiling the guard special form.
  * Re-sync'd ChangeLog with darcs changes.
  * Updated Makefile to employ gnu99 for building the virtual machine.
  * Restricted the info field of the error type to pairs.
  * Added the MQO_FOREACH macro for iterating over a list.
  * Added the newline primitive.

- 12/23/2005, Introduction of the Error / Guard System.
  * Added the error primitive
  * Added the error object type.
  * Added the RAG opcode.
  * Added the GAR opcode.
  * Added the MQO_ERROR macro for signalling errors.
  * Added the MQO_EXIT macro for long jumping back to the top level interpreter 
    loop.
  * Added the MQO_GP register to contain a stack of active guard objects.
  * Renamed the error_handler object type to guard.
  * Added the REST_ARGS macro for use by primitives.
  * Added the OPT_INTEGER_ARG macro for use by primitives.
  * Added the mqo_show_error function, and added the ability for the show 
    primitive to show errors.
  * Added the guard special form.
  * Added test cases for compilation of the guard special form.
  * Altered compile.scm to compile the guard special form.
  * Added the show primitive.  (A bastardized display, with optional item 
    ellision. )
  * Added the examples/g2.ms example, which demonstrates the use of a guard.
  * Added the errorq, error-key, error-info primitives.

- 12/18/2005, Reduction of Opcodes to Unbound Primitives
  * mqo_exec now uses continuation passing style.
  * All opcodes are now implemented as unbound mqo primitives, and the
    toplevel interpreter loop has been amended to permit primitives to affect
    instruction flow.
  * Fixed error merging symbols.
  * Ensured that END_PRIM moves to the next primitive.
  * Added the REQ_VALUE_ARG macro for use by primitives.
  * Renamed NO_ARGS to NO_MORE_ARGS.
  * Added the MQO_NO_RESULT macro for signalling that a primitive has an 
    unspecified result.
  * Added the pair?, null?, cons, car, cdr, set-car!, set-cdr! and length
    primitives.

- 12/17/2005, Implementation of Let Compression
  * Altered compiler and virtual machine to employ "let compression"; at the
    beginning of a function's evaluation, it allocates memory for all variables
    bound within its lexical scope.
  * Altered compilation of let to expand the allocation of variables, and
    assign values to those variables.
  * Altered compilation of let in the top level to implicitly create a new
    lambda and apply the supplied values against it, similar to a conventional
    Scheme implementation of let.
  * Expanded the SPOT Test system, added the ability to conditionally disable
    spot tests.
  * Added tests for the context registry employed by the compiler.

- 12/9/2005, Vectorization of MOSVM IL
  * The MOSVM compiler now generates a vector for each program, instead of a
  list.  This vector is used by the MOSVM interpreter, gaining
  a considerable performance increase over the traditional SECD use of
  lists.
  * Added closure type to memory.
  * Added primitive type to memory.
  * Moved all operations that are not required to construct a function
    call to primitives.
  * Made VM registers global so primitives can modify them.
  * Made the data and return stack into a vector for speed purposes.
  * Made the environment a list of vectors.
  * Expanded CALL to accept either a primitive or a closure.
  * Expanded USEA and USEN to pre-allocate a context for all internal
    bound variables.
  * Added JF and JMP opcodes.
